Overview
--------
This is an experimental project with the goal of producing a worship rota
involves planning worship bands for every Sunday over a 12 week period
(term), taking into account:

- Musician availability
- Instrument Combinations
- Musician Strength
- Serving frequency (e.g. employed servers will serve 3/4 Sundays while
  most others will serve between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3)

Rota Logic
----------
Every Sunday MUST have at least 1 “Worship Leader” and 1 “Lead Musician”.
When a Worship Leader can play an instrument they can simultaneously be the
Worship Leader and the Lead Musician, however a Worship Leader who is a
vocalist will require a separate Lead Musician to support them.

A number of musicians can play multiple instruments and occupy the role of
either a worship leader, lead musician or supporting musician. E.g. I can
lead worship and be lead musician on guitar, or be the lead musician on
guitar, or be a supporting musician on electric guitar or drums.

The rota process is as follows:

1. Musicians provide their availability for a 12 week period
2. Worship Leaders and Lead Musicians are allocated to the 12-week period
   factoring in availability.
3. Individuals should not exceed their serving capacity in a given 12 week
   period. I.e. someone who is down to be serving 1 in 4 weeks should only
   appear on the rota of a 12-week period 3x.
4. Worship Leaders should be distributed evenly across the term
5. Worship Leaders with a lower rota frequency should generally have the same
   or similar priority as a Worship Leader with a higher rota frequency.
   Worship Leaders with a higher rota frequency may end up leading more, but
   generally this should be because of spaces left in the rota. Worship
   Leading should be spread evenly across all Worship Leaders.
6. Once the Worship Leaders and Lead Musicians have been allocated, the rest
   of the band is filled out. This requires consideration of both availability
   and band composition. The following are acceptable band compositions:

    - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar
    - Worship Leader + Piano
    - Worship Leader + Piano + Acoustic Guitar (Not preferred)
    - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Bass + Drums
    - Worship Leader + Piano + Bass + Drums
    - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Drums (Not preferred)
    - Worship Leader + Piano + Drums (Not preferred)
    - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Bass + Drums + Electric Guitar
    - Worship Leader + Piano + Bass + Drums + Electric Guitar
    - Any of the above combinations + Soloist instrument (e.g. saxophone/cello)
    - Any of the above combinations + backing vocalist

7. The system shall provide a means to input musician availability over a 12
   week period
8. The system shall allow configurable limits to be set for serving frequency.
9. The system shall prevent musicians from exceeding their rota frequency.
10. Worship Leaders shall have the same rota priority regardless of rota
    frequency.
11. The system shall have the following musicians and roles:

     - Worship Leader role
     - Lead Musician role
     - Vocalist
     - Acoustic Guitar
     - Piano
     - Bass
     - Electric Guitar
     - Soloist (e.g. cello/saxophone)

12. The system shall allow individual Musicians to be multiple instrumentalists
13. The system shall allow Individual Musicians to occupy multiple roles
    simultaneously.
14. The system shall consider musicians to be able to only play one instrument
    at a time
15. The system shall rota musicians into acceptable band compositions. The
    acceptable band compositions are as follows:

     - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar
     - Worship Leader + Piano
     - Worship Leader + Piano + Acoustic Guitar (Not preferred)
     - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Bass + Drums
     - Worship Leader + Piano + Bass + Drums
     - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Drums (Not preferred)
     - Worship Leader + Piano + Drums (Not preferred)
     - Worship Leader + Acoustic Guitar + Bass + Drums + Electric Guitar
     - Worship Leader + Piano + Bass + Drums + Electric Guitar
     - Any of the above combinations + Soloist instrument (e.g.
       saxophone/cello)
     - Any of the above combinations + backing vocalist

16. The system shall prioritise more desirable band configurations over less
    desirable band configurations.
